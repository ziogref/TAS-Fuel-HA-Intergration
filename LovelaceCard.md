# Guide: Dynamic Fuel Price Lovelace Card

### Objective

This guide will show you how to create a single Lovelace card that displays:

1.  An automatically populated list of your "Favourite" fuel stations at the top, sorted by price.
2.  A dynamic list of all other fuel stations, also automatically sorted from cheapest to most expensive.
3.  The ability to exclude specific brands (e.g., United) from the dynamic list.

### Part 1: Prerequisites

This card requires two custom frontend components from the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS).

1.  **Install HACS:** If you haven't already, install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) in your Home Assistant instance.
2.  **Install Required Cards via HACS:**
    * Open HACS in your Home Assistant sidebar.
    * Go to the "Frontend" section.
    * Click the blue "+ EXPLORE & DOWNLOAD REPOSITORIES" button.
    * Search for and download each of the following cards:
        * **`auto-entities`**
        * **`vertical-stack-in-card`**
    * Follow the on-screen instructions for both. A Home Assistant restart may be required after installation.

### Part 2: Creating the Lovelace Card

We will use the `vertical-stack-in-card` to combine two different cards into a single, seamless element on your dashboard.

1.  Navigate to the dashboard where you want to add the card and click the three dots in the top right, then select "**Edit Dashboard**".
2.  Click the "**+ ADD CARD**" button.
3.  Scroll to the bottom of the list and select the "**Manual**" card.
4.  Delete the placeholder content (`type: entities`) and paste the YAML code from the section below.

### Part 3: The YAML Code

Copy the entire code block below and paste it into the Manual card editor. Explanations for each section are provided below the code.

```yaml
type: custom:vertical-stack-in-card
title: Unleaded 91 Prices
cards:
  - type: custom:auto-entities
    card:
      type: entities
      title: '‚≠ê My Favourites'
      show_header_toggle: false
    filter:
      include:
        - attributes:
            'User favourite': true
        - entity_id: '*_u91'
    sort:
      method: state
      numeric: true
  - type: custom:auto-entities
    card:
      type: entities
      show_header_toggle: false
    filter:
      include:
        - domain: sensor
          # This selects all sensors for a specific fuel type.
          # Change 'u91' to your desired fuel type (e.g., 'p98', 'dl').
          entity_id: '*_u91'
      exclude:
        # Exclude stations that are already in the favourites list.
        - attributes:
            'User favourite': true
        # Exclude a specific brand.
        - attributes:
            brand: United
    sort:
      method: state
      numeric: true
```

### How This Code Works

* **`type: custom:vertical-stack-in-card`**: This is the container that holds our two cards and makes them look like a single element.
* **`title: Unleaded 91 Prices`**: The main title for the entire card. You can change this to whatever you like.

#### Card 1: Your Favourites (Dynamic)

* **`type: custom:auto-entities`**: This card now dynamically finds your favourites.
* **`filter:`**: It includes any sensor for the specified fuel type (`*_u91`) that has the `'User favourite': true` attribute. Note the quotes around the attribute name, which are required because of the space.
* **`sort: { method: state, numeric: true }`**: This now sorts your favourites by price (cheapest first) for a consistent and useful order.

#### Card 2: The Main List (Dynamic)

* **`type: custom:auto-entities`**: This card populates the rest of the list.
* **`filter:`**: 
    * **`include:`**: It grabs all sensors for the specified fuel type (e.g., `*_u91`). **You must change this** to match the fuel type you want to display.
    * **`exclude:`**: It removes any sensor where `'User favourite'` is `true` (to prevent duplicates) and any sensor from an excluded brand (like "United").
* **`sort:`**:
    * `method: state`: This sorts the list based on the fuel price.
    * `numeric: true`: This ensures prices are sorted correctly as numbers.

After pasting the YAML, click "**SAVE**". Your card will now automatically display your favourites at the top, sorted by price, followed by a dynamically sorted list of all other stations.
